Tips for making Tail letters like the AK livery!

This implies mainly for gimp. 

Start with the left tail. Create a copy of Blanktail.png (Models/Liveries)

Add some text on the tail With this formating to make it stand out on the model.


As always: See the Example tails in the folder AK for some ideas.

It Dosent have to be like this but i think this looks good

For the 2 big main letters 
ie. AK FF YV, etc 
use Arial with a bold effect and a font size of 98


for the AF letters underneath to the left of the main letters and the numbers underneath AF,  
use Arial with bold again and with a size of 37

For secondary numbers  ie "001" that i have on the AK tail

Use font size 60
Arial with bold effect


Then once your done with the left tail. Before you anchore it all down to the blank tail. merge all the text into one layer.
Then export it as PNG. Besure to turn on interlacing in the export menu. (not that this means anything 

Now to make the right one. 
If you merged all the text into one layer. 
Press Shift-F to get into the flip mode. and flip all the text.

then save that as the right tail.

Hope this helped!

Have fun!
