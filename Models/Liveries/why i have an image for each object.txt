when i make the little objects be mapped on a huge texture. in ac3d they appear transparent ish at certain camera angles. this problem appears in flightgear too.
The solution is to make an object be mapped on the image of its size 
This makes intel GPUs run this aircraft better.

So sticking to use one file per texture seems like a good alternative
and they can be greatly customized to an unlimited extent with high quality
