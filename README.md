How to use the missiles:

# Important keys:

if its a heat seeking missile (aim-9)
Turn hard in any direction (left or right) and spam l

m switches the current air-to-air missile
n switches the current air-to-gnd bomb/missile

w switches the master weapon mode. eaither guns or missiles.
When in missile mode. use n/m to chose what weapon you shoot

e shoots the currently selected weapon, itll shoot the gun when your Guns are selected. 

# Radar stuff:

The FCR on the MFD's is the radar screen

press Shift-R to enable / disable the radar.

r changes the radars range.

Once your selected. Drop a missile and the missile will home to its target. Same for the bombs!
