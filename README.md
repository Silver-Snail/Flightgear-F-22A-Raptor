Then drag that to 
 
Windows: C:\Program Files\FlightGear 2020.3\data\Aircraft  

Linux:  Put the newly made F-22 folder in usr/share/games/flightgear/aircraft

Or if you have a custom aircraft folder put F-22 in there


"Or the directory your installed aircrafts are" --realuapilot

See the aircraft help in game to learn how to use every single feature in the jet!
And information on the FDM

A good aircraft has to have a nice help option! very Important


This model is a heavily edited version of the F-22 from the FGUK Hangar.

Missile status: They track and shoot just fine. Damage over multiplayer works too, but the target recives no missile alert. and i dont know if there affected by chaff/flare

MK83 JDAMs are on my todo list...
